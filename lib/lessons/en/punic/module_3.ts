However, pronunciation changed significantly.</p><h4>Vowel Shifts</h4><p>Punic inscriptions written with Latin letters give us insight into vowel changes:</p><ul><li>The short, unstressed vowel /a/ in open syllables often shifted to /o/ or /u/. Example: The Semitic word /kull/ ('all') became /kol/ in Punic, written <code class="punic">ê§äê§ã</code>.</li><li>The long vowel /ƒÅ/ had already shifted to /≈ç/ in Phoenician (the "Canaanite Shift"), and this remained in Punic. Example: /≈°al≈çm/ ("peace").</li></ul><h4>Weak Gutturals</h4><p>The guttural sounds <code> æ, h, ·∏•,  ø</code> became very weak. This affected verb roots containing these letters, often causing them to merge with vowels. For instance, the pronoun <code>h æ</code> (<code class="punic">ê§Ñê§Ä</code>) "he," was often pronounced without the initial /h/ sound, closer to /u/.</p>`;
