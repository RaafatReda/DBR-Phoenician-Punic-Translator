export const content = `<h3>Sentence Structure</h3><h4>Nominal Sentences</h4><p>Sentences that state "A is B" often do not use a verb for "to be." The subject is simply followed by the predicate.</p><ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> <code>h-mlk ṭb</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤄𐤌𐤋𐤊 𐤈𐤁</code>) — "The king [is] good."</li></ul><h4>The Genitive Construct</h4><p>To show possession, two nouns are placed together. The first noun (the possessed) is in the "construct state" and the second (the possessor) is in the "absolute state." The construct noun cannot take the definite article.</p><ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> <code>spr h-mlk</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤎𐤐𐤓 𐤄𐤌𐤋𐤊</code>) — "the book of the king" (lit. "book-of the-king").</li></ul><h4>The Direct Object Marker</h4><p>The particle <code>ʾyt</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤀𐤉𐤕</code>) is placed before a <strong>definite</strong> direct object. It has no translation in English.</p><ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> <code>brk ʾyt h-mlk</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤁𐤓𐤊 𐤀𐤉𐤕 𐤄𐤌𐤋𐤊</code>) — "He blessed the king."</li></ul>`;
