export const content = `<h3>Phonology & Assimilation</h3><p>Phoenician phonology included several sounds not common in English, particularly the gutturals.</p><ul><li><strong>Gutturals:</strong> Phoenician distinguished between guttural sounds like <code>ḥ</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤇</code>) and <code>ʿ</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤏</code>), which were pronounced deep in the throat.</li><li><strong>Emphatics:</strong> It also had emphatic consonants like <code>ṭ</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤈</code>) and <code>ṣ</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤑</code>), which had a stronger, more forceful articulation.</li><li><strong>Assimilation of Nun (נ):</strong> The consonant <code>n</code> (<code class="phoenician">𐤍</code>), when it appeared at the end of a syllable before another consonant, often assimilated into that consonant, causing it to be doubled. For example, the prefix <code>*min-</code> ("from") could become <code>mi-</code> before a doubled consonant.</li></ul>`;
